# Overview

SopaSpan is a Python library for the analysis of spatial biology/omics data. It is heavily based on Sopa and MuSpan, combining elements of both into a single generic workflow:

# Installation

> [!NOTE]
> SopaSpan depends on Tensorflow and while Tensorflow will run on all operating systems, support for GPU processing is generally only supported on Linux - see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for more information.

## Step 1: Install a Python Distribution

We recommend using conda as it's relatively straightforward and makes the management of different Python environments simple. You can install conda from [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) (miniconda will suffice).

## Step 2: Set Up Environment

### Step 2.1: Create an environment

Once conda is installed, open a terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and run the following series of commands:

```bash
conda create --name spatial-bio python=3.12
conda activate spatial-bio
```

You will be presented with a list of packages to be downloaded and installed. The following prompt will appear:
```bash
Proceed ([y]/n)?
```
Hit Enter and all necessary packages will be downloaded and installed - this may take some time.

### Step 2.2: Install pip dependencies

The following dependencies are required and must be installed in the correct order:

#### 2.2.1: Tensorflow

SopaSpan depends on [Stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) to segment cell nuclei, which in turn depends on Tensorflow.

On Linux, install tensorflow as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
```

On any other operating system:

```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow
```

#### 2.2.2: Sopa

Install [Sopa](https://gustaveroussy.github.io/sopa/) with support for stardist and wsi (whole slide imaging) using the following:

```bash
python -m pip install 'sopa[stardist,wsi]'
```

#### 2.2.3: MuSpan

Unfortunately, at this time, MuSpan requires a username and password to install. You can obtain these by completing the form [here](https://www.muspan.co.uk/get-the-code). Once you receive a response by email, MuSpan can be installed as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install https://docs.muspan.co.uk/code/latest.zip
```

You will then be prompted to enter the login credentials you received by email and the installation should proceed.

#### 2.2.4: Get the code for this repository

To get the necessary python code to run SopaSpan, the recommended approach is to [clone this repository using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Alternatively, you can download a Zip file of the repo by clicking on the green code button above and then clicking "Download Zip":

Unzip the contents of the zip file once downloaded - the contents should contain a file called sopaspan.py.

## Step 3: All Done!

That's it - your set up is complete. You can deactivate the environment you have created with the following command.

```bash
conda deactivate
```

# Usage

To run SopaSpan, use the following:

```bash
conda activate spatial-bio
python <path_to_sopaspan.py> -i <path_to_input_file> -o <path_to_output_zarr> -p <path_to_output_plots_directory>
```

Three arguments can be passed, specifying the input and where outputs should be saved:
* -i: this is the path to the input image. While only TIFF files have been tested, it should be possible to run SopaSpan on most common file formats.
* -o: before running, the input image will be converted to a [SpatialData object](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02212-x), a form of Zarr file. This parameter tells SopaSpan where to save this Zarr file.
* -p: path to directory where all output plots will be saved
